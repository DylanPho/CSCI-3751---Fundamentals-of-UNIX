#### Response:

With the vast amount of open-source code and information readily available online, it is important to find a balance between learning from existing resources and maintaining academic and professional integrity. **Plagiarism not only stunts personal growth but also damages credibility in the long run.** To avoid this, one should always **properly credit sources** when using code snippets or ideas from external repositories such as GitHub or Stack Overflow. 

At the same time, leveraging open code can be highly beneficial for learning and problem-solving. Instead of directly copying solutions, one should aim to **understand the logic behind the code and implement it in their own way**. Additionally, modifying and improving exisitng open-source projects while acknowledging/crediting the original authors creates a culture of ethical collaboration in the tech community.

In the professional world, software developers often reuse code in the form of libraries and frameworks, but they **usually stick to licensing agreements and credit original contributors**. Adopting this mindset early in one's academic journey ensures both ethical integrity and effective learning. By embracing transparency and originality, students can maximize the benefits of shared knowledge while upholding ethical standards.
