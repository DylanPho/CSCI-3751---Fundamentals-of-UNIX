Explanation of Why Redirection Fails

When running the command:

sort file1 > file1
the redirection (>) fails because:

- The shell processes > file1 before executing sort file1.
- This causes file1 to be emptied before sort reads from it.
- Since sort gets an empty input file, it produces no output, resulting in file1 being empty.


Corrected Command
To sort and overwrite the file safely, use:

sort file1 -o file1

Explanation of the Fix:
- The -o option in sort specifies the output file, allowing sorting to be done in-place without prematurely truncating the file.
