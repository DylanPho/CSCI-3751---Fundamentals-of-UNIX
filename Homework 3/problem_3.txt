Problem 3 (24 points): 
At the shell command prompt, enter piped commands that take a text file as input and display the top ‘n’ most frequently occurring words in descending order.  The links to the input text files are listed in section 6 below.
You should limit the number of commands to less than 10.

Below are the expected outputs from executing the commands.  
1. Input: Lincoln.txt (Lincoln’s Gettysburg speech), top 5 words
Expected output:

13 that
11 the
10 we
8 to
8 here

Code: 

# Step 1: Convert non-alphabetic characters to newlines (splitting words)
# Step 2: Convert uppercase letters to lowercase for uniformity
# Step 3: Sort words alphabetically
# Step 4: Count occurrences of each unique word
# Step 5: Sort words by frequency in descending order
# Step 6: Display the top 5 most frequently occurring words
tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' < Lincoln.txt | \
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5

Output:

  13 that
  11 the
  10 we
   8 to
   8 here

2. Input: Kennedy.txt (Kennedy’s inaugural speech), top 3 words
Expected output:

33 the
24 of
22 to

Code:

# Process the Kennedy.txt file to extract the top 3 most frequent words
tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' < Kennedy.txt | \
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3

Output:

  33 the
  24 of
  22 to
