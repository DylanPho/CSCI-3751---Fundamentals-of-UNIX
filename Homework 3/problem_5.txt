You may use the same Unix commands in Question 2 but now put them into a (bash) shell script (say, wordCounter).  Shell scripting (programming) enables you to do more than what’s done in Question 2 and we want to take advantage of some of those features.

Some suggestions:

- Use a looping construct to process the input, file by file, without writing the same code repetitively.
- There are many ways to handle multiple files.  In this exercise, you are asked to use an array variable to store the file names
- Consider using the 'shift’ command to shift(move) to the next argument. 
- Do not worry about minor discrepancies in the number of frequencies from my example shown below because they can be slightly different depending on how you handle the word delimiters.

Code:

#!/bin/bash

# Check if correct arguments are given
if [ "$#" -lt 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <n> <file1> <file2> ..."
    exit 1
fi

# Extract the first argument as the number of top words to display
N=$1
shift  # Remove first argument, leaving only file names

# Loop through all files provided as arguments
for file in "$@"; do
    if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
        echo "File $file not found!"
        continue
    fi

    echo "==== Processing: $file ===="

    # Count the number of lines, words, and characters
    wc_output=$(wc "$file")
    echo "=== $wc_output ==="

    # Extract and count words, sort by frequency, and display top N
    tr -c '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]' < "$file" | grep -v "^\s*$" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n "$N"

    echo "========================="
done

Output:
